- 👋 Hi, I’m Kat Prata
- 👀 I’m interested in population genomics of corals and photogrammetry, "reefscape genomics"
- 🌱 I’m currently working on estimating generational dispersal distances in corals
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pop gen studies, obtaining ecologically meaningful metrics from photogrammetry of coral reefs, or programming and bioinfomatics teaching.
